#### **The Challenge**

A monolith application running all services on a single node needs to modernize for high availability and performance targets.


#### **The Solution**

Migrate the application to [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) and [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) following the high level solution diagram below:

All services deployed using terraform and Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with AWS CloudTrail enabled.  

#### **The Benefits**

A scalable, secure, repeatable, highly available solution for the application and database.  With the application previously being containerized it also had the least impact on the application teams.
